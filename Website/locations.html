            Dragonstone is a castle on the island of the same name at the entrance to Blackwater Bay, below the Dragonmont. It was the original seat
            of House Targaryen in Westeros, and had been colonized and fortified as the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold.

          <p class="location-text">
            Shaped from stone to look like dragons, the castle has a dark reputation. A grim place, Dragonstone was built by Valyrians with arcane
            arts, fire, and sorcery. Capable of liquefying and reshaping stone with dragonflame, the dragonlords used their magic to shape Dragonstone
            to look like multiple dragons.

            the Red Keep, the seat of the King of the Andals and the First Men (hence the name). It enjoys a warm climate and life there is luxurious
            for those that can afford it, although it is not without its slums such as Flea Bottom. The city is overpopulated and dangerous at the

            Winterfell is the capital of the Kingdom of the North and the seat and the ancestral home of the royal House Stark. It is a very large
            castle located at the center of the North, from where the head of House Stark rules over his or her people.
          </p>
          <p class="location-text">
            Winterfell is a huge castle complex spanning several acres and encircled by two massive granite walls. There is a village outside, the
            winter town. Winterfell has been built around an ancient godswood and over natural hot springs. The water is piped through walls and
            chambers to heat them, making Winterfell more comfortable than other castles during the harsh northern winters.
          </p>
          <p class="location-text">
            Inside the walls, the complex is composed of dozens of courtyards and small open spaces. Weapons training and practice take place in those
            yards. The inner ward is a second, much older open space in the castle where archery practice takes place. It is located next to the
            broken tower. Inside Winterfell stands the inner castle, which contains the Great Keep and the Great Hall. Winterfell's towers and halls
            have diamond-shaped window panes.
          </p>
          <p class="location-text">
            The godswood of Winterfell consists of three acres of forest within the walls of Winterfell. The heart tree of the godswood is a weirwood.

            Casterly Rock, nicknamed the Rock, is a castle and the seat of House Lannister. The capital of the westerlands, it is on the ocean road
            and overlooks the harbor of Lannisport and the Sunset Sea. Casterly Rock is carved out of a colossal stone hill beside the Sunset Sea. It
            is popularly believed to resemble a lion in repose at sunset.
          </p>
          <p class="location-text">
            The Rock is two leagues (six miles) long from west to east and has a width of two miles from north to south. Its peak is about 2,100 feet
            high which makes it three times as high as the highest point of the Wall and taller than the Hightower of Oldtown too.

            Lannisport is a walled city in the westerlands located less than a mile south of Casterly Rock, the seat of House Lannister.

          <p class="location-text">
            Lannisport is located along the coast of the Sunset Sea where the river road, the gold road, and the ocean road meet. It is one of the

          <p class="location-text">
            The Eyrie is an ancient castle and seat of House Arryn, one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility, within the Vale of Arryn. It is
            situated in the Mountains of the Moon on a shoulder of the peak known as the Giant's Lance, several thousand feet above the valley below.
            Although small compared to the seats of other Great Houses in Westeros, the Eyrie is considered impregnable to attack. During wintertime,
            the Arryns seek refuge against the cold in the Gates of the Moon at the base of the mountain.
          </p>
          <p class="location-text">
            The Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles, being no larger than Maegor's Holdfast. The castle is made of fine white stone. Its seven
            slim, white towers are bunched tightly together and can hold up to five hundred men. The waterfall known as Alyssa's Tears can be heard
            from the Eyrie, and falcons fly near the castle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Moon Door is a narrow weirwood door that stands between two slender pillars halfway in the High Hall. A crescent moon is carved into
            the door, which opens inward and is barred by three heavy bronze bars. The door opens into the sky. Most executions at the Eyrie use this
            door, which opens onto a six hundred foot drop to the stones of the valley below.
          </p>
          <p class="location-text">
            Sky cells are the Eyrie's infamous dungeons. They are shelves on the side of the mountain's sheer cliffs, left open to the cold sky, with
            slightly sloping floors to unnerve the prisoners. Many prisoners, driven mad by the cold and howling wind, commit suicide rather than
            remain imprisoned.
          </p>
          <p class="location-text">
            The Eyrie is located six hundred feet above a waycastle, Sky. Using handholds carved into the rock within the Giant's Lance, visitors can
            climb a ladder-like chimney, which leads from Sky up to the castle's undercellar.

            The Dothraki sea is a vast inland region of the continent of Essos, located east of the Free Cities, north of Slaver's Bay, and west of
            the Bone Mountains. Its landscape of steppes and plains is home to the nomadic Dothraki equestrian people, who constantly battle each
            other and raid surrounding lands. Its only inhabited city, Vaes Dothrak, lies at the heart of the sea, and is home and heart to the

          <p class="location-text">
            Vaes Dothrak is the heart of the Dothraki sea and culture. It is at once one of the largest cities, due to its expansive layout, and one
            of the smallest, due to its small inhabitant population. It has broad, windswept streets paved in grass and mud. There are carved stone
            pavilions, manses of woven grass, wooden towers, stepped pyramids and log halls. All of the buildings were brought to the city by slaves
            from the lands the Dothraki have conquered.

            The godsway runs from the Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak to the Mother of Mountains. It is lined with monuments and holy symbols from a
            hundred different religions on both sides, showing the vast range and power of the Dothraki's conquests. Along the way it passes through
            the Western and Eastern Markets, the lake named the Womb of the World and a pit where important ceremonies are done in Vaes Dothrak.

            The Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak, also simply called the horse gate, is the entrance to the city of Vaes Dothrak in the Dothraki sea. It is
            not a true gate, as there are no gates or walls in the city. Instead, it is named for two gigantic bronze stallions whose hooves meet a
            hundred feet above the roadway to form a pointed arch. The Horse Gate can be seen from a distance, framing the great purple mountain which
            the Dothraki name the Mother of Mountains. The path beneath the horse gate is the godsway, where monuments and holy symbols from a hundred
            different religions line both sides, showing the vast range and power of the Dothraki's conquests.
